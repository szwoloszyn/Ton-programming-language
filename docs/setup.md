## 1. Requirements
- **C++ 17**: A compiler that supports C++ 17
- **CMake**: Version 3.14 or higher
- **ANtlr4 tool**: Version 4.13.2
- **Java**: JRE 11 or higher (required to run the ANTLR4 `.jar` generator tool).

Script for linux and windows are currently being developed

## 3. Building From Source



### Generating Grammar-Based Files.

Tøn uses ANTLR4 to parse its syntax. The first step is to generate the C++ lexer and parser files from the grammar .g4 file. You can do this with the following command

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Cpp -visitor -listener -o antlr4_generated Ton.g4
```

<br>

### Compiling The Code
Once the parser files are generated, use CMake to configure the project and compile the source code into an executable.

#####  Windows :poop:
```bash
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -B build
cmake --build build
# ^ Use -j [num of cores] for faster building
```


#####  Linux :penguin:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
# ^ Use -j [num of cores] for faster building
# ^ [num of cores] = -1 takes all there is
```

<br>

*If the compilation is successful, you will find the executable file (e.g., `ton_app`) inside your `build` directory.*

## 4. Running Test Script

With the interpreter successfully built, you should be able to run simple Tøn script. Instrument features are not available since we did not setup `.sf2` file yet.

Create a simple test file named `hello_ton.ton`:

```text
$ hello_music.ton
!shout "It's Tønesame!"
```

Run the script by passing the file to your newly compiled interpreter, assuming you are in the project root directory:
```bash
./build/ton_app path/to/hello_music.ton

```

If everything is set up correctly, your terminal will print given `STRING` on standard output.

> **Note:** Since `ton_app` is a regular executable it is highly recommended to move it into $PATH or create a symlink to the original file in order to be able to run Tøn scripts from any file location.

## 5. Setting Up the SoundFont Library
To harness the full power of Tøn, you must attach `FluidR3_GM.sf2` file to the language, which allows you to create `SOUND`s based on real instruments samples (visit [Audio Docs](./audio.md) for syntax details). 
First, you need to download the file from official GitHub repository. The file is distributed under [**MIT** License](https://github.com/pianobooster/fluid-soundfont/blob/main/COPYING).
Now, from **project root** directory run following commands:

#####  Linux :penguin:
```bash
mkdir -p data
cd data
DOWNLOAD_URL="https://github.com/pianobooster/fluid-soundfont/releases/download/v3.1/FluidR3_GM.sf2"
wget --show-progress -O "FluidR3_GM.sf2" "$DOWNLOAD_URL"
```

#####  Windows :poop:
```
# co tu sie robi tu ??
```

Now, you will find `FluidR3_GM.sf2` file located in `/path/to/project/root/data` directory. It will work out of the box when running Tøn scripts directly from project root directory. However,to simplify the workflow and enable global access, it is highly recommended to move `.sf2` file into `$HOME/.ton` directory (`C:\Users\YourUsername\.ton` on Windows :poop:). Because this is the interpreter's primary search path, Tøn will be able to locate the SoundFont regardless of which directory you run your scripts from.
